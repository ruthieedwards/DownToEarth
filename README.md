# DownToEarth
A game 66 million years in the making, Down to Earth is a game about the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. You, an anachronistic cavewoman, are Earth’s only hope against the asteroids. Shoot them down with your coconut bambooka to protect the planet’s flora and fauna from an inevitable, firey death. Made for Ludum Dare 46.
